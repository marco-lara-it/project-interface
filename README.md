# project-interface
In this project the users can interface a GoogleSheet through a GUI

at this point there are two scripts that read and write on the googlesheet.
- script.py is linked to the document
- script1.py looks for the document on the google drive and after that writes and read 
- script2.py is the adjustment of the guide at this link https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python?hl=it
